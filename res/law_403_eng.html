                    When landlords rent out their properties, they are most afraid of encountering bad tenants. If they
                    encounter unscrupulous tenants, they may not receive rent payments, or worse, they may mistakenly
                    commit a crime of invasion of the tenant's residence, leading to irreversible losses. On the other
                    hand, when tenants rent a property, they are also afraid of encountering bad landlords or even fake
                    landlords, leading to the loss of the deposit or rent payment they have already made. Therefore,
                    when choosing a contracting party, both landlords and tenants should be cautious.

                            When a landlord intends to rent out a property, in addition to being cautious about their
                            own and their family's safety when showing the property to strangers, they should also pay
                            attention to the following factors when selecting tenants:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Landlords should be aware of whether the tenant is of legal age. If the tenant is under
                                20 years old, it is best to obtain the consent of their parents, legal guardians, or
                                custodians when signing the contract to avoid troubles arising from parental
                                disagreement afterwards. However, if it can be established that renting the property is
                                necessary for the tenant's daily life (such as for a student in school), the lease
                                agreement is still valid even without the consent of their parents.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Landlords should pay attention to the character, special living habits, and occupations
                                of their tenants. They should be particularly cautious about tenants who have unclear
                                household registration, frequent relocation, unstable employment, or cannot be contacted
                                easily. In such cases, it is best to keep a photocopy of the tenant's ID card to avoid
                                situations where rent cannot be collected or the tenant cannot be found in the future.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Landlords should pay attention to the motivation of tenants when renting out their
                                property. Those who intend to use the property for illegal purposes (such as operating a
                                gambling arcade) should be refused, and if discovered later, the authorities should be
                                notified to protect one's own interests. There have been cases where landlords knowingly
                                rented out their property to tenants running illegal gambling arcades and ended up being
                                prosecuted as accomplices to gambling crimes, resulting in significant losses.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It is recommended to ask the tenant to present identification when signing the contract
                                to prevent fraudulent leasing under a false identity.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If the tenant is a legal entity (such as a company, association, etc.), the contract
                                should be signed by the representative of the legal entity or by an agent authorized by
                                the representative to sign the contract. It should be avoided to rent to a legal entity
                                using a personal name, to prevent disputes in the future. Additionally, it should be
                                noted that if a company's rental expenses need to be accounted for and reported for tax
                                purposes, both parties need to agree on who is responsible for paying the rental income
                                tax in advance to avoid future trouble.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If the tenant is a foreigner, attention should be paid to the legal age of majority in
                                their home country.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Attention should be paid to whether the tenant is renting for their own use or for their
                                family's use, whether it is a single person renting or several people renting jointly.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                            Tenants usually belong to the economically disadvantaged group in society, and their
                            disputes often involve issues such as excessive rent or deposit, unreasonable rent hikes, or
                            landlords refusing to return the deposit upon the end of the lease. Therefore, when choosing
                            a landlord, tenants should not only pay attention to their own safety (especially female
                            tenants), but also consider the following factors:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If the landlord is a minor, they must obtain the consent of their parents, legal
                                guardian, or custodian before renting out the property.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When signing the contract, tenants should understand whether the landlord is the owner
                                of the property. Tenants may ask the landlord to provide the property deed or
                                registration copy. If the landlord is not the owner of the property, they should provide
                                proof of authorization. At the same time, it is best to ask the landlord to show their
                                identification to avoid being deceived.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Female tenants should pay special attention to the landlord's family situation and
                                character, and whether they will be living with the landlord. At the same time, they
                                should also pay attention to the identity, occupation, and character of other tenants.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Pay attention to whether the landlord is a sub-landlord. If so, tenants should
                                understand the rental period and whether the sub-landlord and the main landlord have
                                agreed to prohibit subletting.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If the landlord is a legal entity (such as a company, association, etc.), the contract
                                should be signed by the legal representative of the legal entity, or by an agent who is
                                authorized by law to sign on behalf of the legal entity.
                            </li>

                            <li>應注意房屋是屬合法建物或是違建物，欲長期租用者、最好選擇合法建物。</li>
                            <li>應注意房屋是否已遭法院查封，若已遭查封，應避免簽約承租，否則隨時會有被迫搬遷的可能。</li>
                            <li>應注意房屋所在地的都市計劃土地使用分區係屬住宅區、商業區或工業區。</li>
                            <li>應注意房屋四週的環境，一般住家或學生應避免租在四週有特種營業場所的房屋。</li>
                            <li>女房客應注意房屋之防盜設備是否安全。</li>
                            <li>應注意承租之房屋的樓層是否是頂樓加蓋，若為地下室是否是防空避難室。</li>
                            <li>應了解房屋內所提供之既有設備，如衛浴、熱水器、桌椅、洗衣機、脫水機、冰箱、廚房、冷氣等是否可供房客使用，及電錶是共用、或各自計算等。</li>

                            為了慎重起見，房客可以記下門牌號碼，直接至當地地政事務所申

                            請該建物的登記簿謄本。從登記簿謄本可以看出誰是所有權人，有無遭

                            法院查封…等各種情況。不動產登記簿是公開的，任何第三人都可以調
