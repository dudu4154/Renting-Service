                Oops... it's not looking good, you and your landlord just can't seem to agree on anything, what can you
                do to solve this? Don't worry, below are some great tips that can help you avoid going to court and come
                out on top!

                        If it is due to uncontrollable external factors such as natural disasters or third-party
                        intrusion, or due to the landlord's problems such as the inability to repair or tidy up the
                        property, the tenant can make such a request. However, if it is due to personal reasons such as
                        hospitalization, imprisonment, or going abroad, the request must be following the agreement
                        specified in the lease. Therefore, students who do not stay during summer or winter breaks and
                        wish not to pay rent must coordinate with the landlord. Otherwise, they should find ways to stay
                        in the rental property to avoid feeling regretful.

                        tenant has the right to request the return of the security deposit from the landlord.

                        A good real estate agent can make finding a place to live easy and convenient, but it can be
                        troublesome when dealing with dishonest agents. When looking for an agent, the first thing to do
                        is to make sure that they have indeed been commissioned by the landlord. When signing the
                        contract and paying the deposit, it is important to confirm the identity of the landlord or
                        their authorized agent. It is best to have a professional agent handle this process, and if the
                        process is fair and just, it is more secure. Also, make sure to pay the service fee only after
                        all the rental procedures have been completed, so that you can do it willingly.

                        landlord. This means that the landlord is responsible for paying all property taxes, and the
                        tenant is not required to pay them.

                        Tenants are not allowed to sublet the rental property to others without the landlord's consent,
                        but they can sublet a portion of it to others. If the tenant wants to sublet the entire
                        property, it must be specified in the original lease agreement. If the tenant violates the
                        subletting agreement, the landlord can terminate the lease at any time, and the tenant cannot
                        object. If the landlord does not terminate the lease, then there is no issue. However, if the
                        landlord terminates the lease, the sub-tenant not only cannot become the primary tenant, but
                        also may have to compensate for any losses incurred. It's a risky move!

                        be withheld by the landlord, such as basic necessities like clothing, bedding, and cooking
                        utensils, or tools necessary for a tenant's profession. Other items can be withheld by the
                        landlord as long as they are located within the rental property, and there is no need to apply
                        to the court for this action, which does not constitute a restriction on freedom.

                        their name on the contract upon receiving it. It is best to take it home and study it carefully,
                        and not be limited by the contents of the contract. As long as the contract has not been signed,
                        there is room for negotiation.

                        the rent. However, the repair cost should not be excessive and should be in line with the market
