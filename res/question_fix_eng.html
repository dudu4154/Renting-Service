            <h2>❏ Repair Issues</h2>
            <p>
                Repair and maintenance issues have always been the top concern for students renting apartments, so it is
                recommended that students make clear agreements in advance to avoid wasting time and energy in
                communication after the fact, which can even lead to the breakdown of the rental relationship.

                        According to Article 429, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Code, <b>the repair of the leased
                            property</b>, unless otherwise agreed in the contract or customary practice, is <b>the
                            responsibility of the landlord</b>. In other words, in principle, when the leased property
                        is damaged, the landlord has an obligation to repair it. However, the two parties can also agree
                        separately on who is responsible for maintenance in the contract, and even specify in the
                        contract which type of property damage is the landlord's responsibility and which is the
                        tenant's responsibility. With such a clear agreement, disputes over repair issues in the future
                        can be avoided.

                        As stipulated in Article 429(1) of the Civil Code, <b>the repair of leased property</b>, unless
                        otherwise agreed in the contract or customary practice, <b>is the responsibility of the
                            lessor</b>. In other words, as a general rule, if a rented property is damaged when leased
                        out, the landlord has an obligation to repair it. However, the two parties can also agree
                        separately on who is responsible for the repairs, and even specify in the contract which types
                        of property damage are the landlord's responsibility and which are the tenant's responsibility.
                        With such clear agreement, disputes over repairs can be avoided in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (Referring to Article 429 of the Civil Code) In principle, if a rented property is damaged or
                        becomes unusable due to normal wear and tear during the tenant's use, such as leaking roof,
                        clogged pipes, corroded lamp bases, etc., the landlord has an obligation to repair them for the
                        tenant's use and occupancy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to the Civil Code, the scope of repairs should cover all rental items, ranging from
                        the hardware structure of the house to the replacement of light bulbs, which should be the
                        responsibility of the landlord. However, if even consumable items such as light bulbs need to be
                        replaced by the landlord, it may cause some impact on the maintenance of the tenancy
                        relationship.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Therefore, if equipment suddenly becomes unusable, the cause should be assessed first, such as
                        whether it was caused by improper operation, whether it can be repaired by oneself with minor
                        parts, or whether it was damaged due to aging equipment. After clarifying the cause and
                        determining the responsibility, communication with the landlord should be easier to reach a
                        consensus and solve the problem as soon as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In any case, to avoid disputes over repair responsibilities, <b>it is recommended that both
                            parties specify the current condition of the equipment and the list of repair
                            responsibilities in the contract when signing, in order to reduce the occurrence of repair
                            disputes.</b>

                        have the obligation to manage the leased property as a good custodian, which means not only
                        maintaining the normal use of the property (not deliberately damaging or soiling the property,
                        changing the structure of the property, etc.), but also notifying the landlord of any potential

                            compensation for the landlord's losses.</b> (Please refer to Article 430-432 of the Civil

                    <p>
                        Article 430 of the Civil Code: "During the continuance of the lease, if repairs are necessary on
                        the leased property and should be borne by the lessor, the lessee may fix a reasonable period of
                        time to urge the lessor to make the necessary repairs. If the lessor fails to make the repairs
                        within the period, the lessee may terminate the contract, or make the repairs and claim
                        reimbursement from the lessor, or deduct the expenses from the rent."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When encountering situations that require repairs, it is common to inform the landlord verbally
                        first. However, if the landlord refuses or delays in handling the repairs, you can write a
                        letter as evidence to inform the landlord to come and make the repairs (sample letter of
                        evidence). If the landlord still does not respond, after the agreed period, the tenant can
                        terminate the lease according to Article 430 of the Civil Code or make repairs by themselves. If
                        the landlord agrees to let you handle the repairs by yourself, it is recommended that you
                        estimate the cost before hiring someone, inform the landlord of the cost to avoid disputes
                        arising from differences in the perception of the repair costs, causing the landlord to refuse
                        to pay. After the repair is completed, all vouchers should be prepared to reimburse the landlord
                        and deduct the expenses from the rent.

                        Advice: Repair issues have always been the most disputed issue. <b>Remind tenants to clearly
                            define responsibility and obligations before signing a contract. In case of problems, try to
                            communicate and reach an agreement as much as possible. Remember not to use harsh words to
                            avoid damaging the relationship between the parties, which may affect future interactions
                            with each other.</b>

                        included in the lease agreement?</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="answer_2" id="answer5" style="display: none;">
                    <p>Generally, repair responsibilities can be divided into several categories:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Hardware structure of the property: such as partitions, walls, pillars, etc.</li>
                        <li>
                            Furniture and equipment: such as sofas, tables and chairs, televisions, refrigerators, etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>Consumable materials: such as light bulbs, lamp tubes, rubber inside water faucets, etc.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        For the parts that require maintenance, it is best to list the equipment and parts involved, and
                        then differentiate the responsibilities. If necessary, photos can be taken as attachments to the
                        contract for documentation purposes.
