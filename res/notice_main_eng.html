                    prevention, and escape routes or stairwells. If the building's exterior is cracked, escape routes or
                    stairwells are blocked with debris, or burglar-proof windows are reserved for escape openings, these
                    are potential safety hazards. Additionally, water heaters should not be installed inside the house.

                    Please invite a few friends to go with you when you visit the house to protect your safety. You can
                    also listen to the opinions of your classmates.

                    When paying the deposit, ask the landlord to provide a receipt that includes the renter's address,
                    the landlord's name, the deposit amount, the ID number, and the scheduled start date. This receipt
                    should also include the rental address, the expected starting date, and the deposit payment date.
                    Having this receipt is important to avoid any disputes or issues with the landlord not acknowledging
                    the rental agreement after receiving the deposit.
