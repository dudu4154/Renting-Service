                The lease agreement is one of the named contracts under the Obligations section of the Civil Code. After
                the landlord and tenant enter into a lease agreement, both parties are bound by the terms of the
                agreement and cannot back out, except by mutual agreement to amend or terminate the contract. The
                termination, cancellation, and extension of the lease are all subject to legal regulations and cannot be
                unilaterally decided by either party. The differences among the three are as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Termination of lease: Refers to the situation where, after the rental contract has been established
                    and become effective, the landlord or tenant does not wish to continue the contract for some reason
                    and allows the contract to expire at a specific time. However, the lease prior to termination
                    remains valid, and therefore the landlord and tenant are not required to restore the premises to
                    their original condition.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Termination of the lease agreement: Refers to the termination of the lease agreement at a specific
                    point in time due to the unwillingness of the landlord or tenant to continue the lease agreement.
                    The lease agreement before termination remains valid, and therefore the landlord and tenant do not
                    need to restore the original condition.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Extension of Lease: Refers to a lease agreement with a fixed term, in which the landlord and tenant
                    agree to extend the lease period without changing the terms of the original lease after it expires.
                    The original lease remains valid throughout the extension period.

                                            (Civil Code Article 451).

                                        The above three types of indefinite lease, originally under the provisions of
                                        the Civil Code, either the landlord or the tenant can terminate the lease at any
                                        time without any reason. However, based on the tenant's habit, it shall prevail
                                        (Article 450, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code). For example, if it is customary to
                                        allow tenants to terminate the lease at any time, but not the landlord, the
                                        landlord still cannot terminate the contract at any time in order to protect the
                                        tenant. However, because the Land Law is a special law of the Civil Code, in
                                        these three situations, if the landlord wants to take back the property, he/she
                                        is still subject to the strict limitations of Article 100 of the Land Law.
                                        Furthermore, according to Article 425 of the Civil Code amended in 1999,
                                        indefinite leases should be notarized. Otherwise, the provision of "sale does
                                        not terminate lease" cannot be applied, and this should not be ignored.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="typesetting">
                                        When terminating a lease, customary notice should be given. For example, if one
                                        month's notice is required according to custom, then one month's notice should
                                        be given. If two weeks' notice is customary, then two weeks' notice should be
                                        given. The length of the notice period is determined entirely by custom.
                                        However, the Civil Code imposes restrictions on the rental of real estate. If
                                        the rent is payable weekly, every half-month, or monthly, the landlord should
                                        take the last day of the week, half-month, or month, as the termination date of
                                        the contract, and should notify the tenant at least one week, half-month, or
                                        month in advance. For example, if the rent is payable monthly, the landlord
                                        should take the last day of the month as the termination date of the contract
                                        and should notify the tenant at least one month in advance.

                                    Fixed-term lease: A lease with a fixed term may not be terminated by either party
                                    without cause before the expiration of the term. However, the parties may agree in
                                    writing to allow one or both parties to terminate the lease before the expiration of
                                    the term. In such cases, the terminating party must provide advance notice as
                                    specified in Article 450-3 of the Civil Code. The relevant provision in Article 453
                                    of the Civil Code states that 'If a party to a lease with a fixed term has the right
                                    to terminate the lease before the expiration of the term as provided for in the
                                    lease, the termination must be preceded by notice as provided for in paragraph 3 of
                                    Article 450.'

                        The lease agreement is one of the 24 named contracts in the Civil Code, but the Civil Code does
                        not have any special provisions regarding the termination of lease agreements. Therefore, except
                        for any special agreements between the parties, the general provisions of the Civil Code should
                        be applied. The following is a summary of the main points:
                    </p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Reasons for the exercise of the right to terminate include: delay in payment. As
                                    leasing is a periodic act that must be performed within a certain period of time to
                                    achieve the purpose of the contract, Article 255 of the Civil Code stipulates that
                                    'where, due to the nature of the contract or the expression of the parties, payment
                                    is not made within a certain period of time, and the purpose of the contract cannot
                                    be achieved, and the other party does not make payment within the time limit, the
                                    other party may terminate the contract without notification.' For example, the
                                    tenant and the landlord have signed a lease and paid the rent and deposit, and have
                                    agreed on the date of occupancy. Both parties have also agreed in the contract that
                                    the purpose of renting the house is to sell goods during the local temple fair held
                                    every 14 years. However, if the landlord is unable to deliver the house on time for
                                    some reason, the tenant may exercise the right to terminate the contract.

                                <li>
                                    Reason for Termination Due to Inability to Make Payment:
                                    Lease agreements are periodic in nature and require timely payments for the
                                    fulfillment of the contract. Article 255 of the Civil Code states that, "If one
                                    party fails to make the required payment within a specified time, which is necessary
                                    to achieve the purpose of the contract, and this is caused by the nature of the
                                    contract or the expression of intent by the parties, the other party may terminate
                                    the contract without the need for prior notice." For example, if a tenant and
                                    landlord have signed a lease agreement, with the tenant providing the rent and
                                    security deposit, and have agreed to the move-in date for the purpose of selling
                                    goods during the local temple fair held every fourteen years, but the landlord is
                                    unable to deliver the property on time due to unforeseen circumstances, the tenant
                                    may exercise their right to terminate the contract.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Termination due to refusal to pay, such as the tenant's refusal to pay rent or the
                                    landlord's refusal to deliver the property for the tenant to reside in.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Termination due to a change of circumstances, such as the situation where the house
                                    becomes unsuitable for living due to earthquake damage.
                                </li>

                            <h3>Methods of Exercising the Right of Termination:</h3>
                            <p class="typesetting">
                                According to Article 258(1) of the Civil Code, "the exercise of the right to terminate
                                shall be made by expressing the intention to the other party." The method of expressing
                                such intention is not specified. In other words, whether it is done face-to-face, orally
                                by telephone, or in writing is all acceptable. However, for the convenience of future
                                evidence, it is recommended to use a registered letter with proof of delivery.

                            <h3>The Effect of Contract Termination:</h3>
                            <p class="typesetting">
                                The effectiveness of the contract is retroactively eliminated by termination, and any
                                unfulfilled obligations are naturally exempted. For obligations that have already been
                                fulfilled, there is a problem of whether the undeserved benefits should be returned due
                                to legal reasons. The legal effects after contract termination are mainly enforced in
                                accordance with the provisions of Articles 259, 260, 261, 264, 265, 266, and 267 of the
                                Civil Code, which primarily impose the obligation to restore the original status.

                        As for the rent, in principle, the amount of rent can be freely agreed upon by the landlord and
                        tenant. However, Article 97, Paragraph 1 of the Land Law provides that 'the rent for urban
                        houses shall not exceed ten percent of the declared total value of the land and its buildings.'
                        The restriction on the rent for houses is to protect tenants who are usually in a weaker
                        position. Regarding the deposit, in addition to paying rent, it is customary for tenants in
                        Taiwan to pay a deposit (referred to as a security deposit in the Land Law) when renting a
                        property. However, Article 99 of the Land Law stipulates that 'the security deposit for a lease
                        shall not exceed two months' total rent for the house. If the deposited security deposit exceeds
                        the above limit, the tenant may use the excess amount to offset the rent.' The Land Law limits
                        the amount of the deposit (security deposit) to protect tenants, and landlords and tenants
                        should pay special attention to this when signing the contract.

                        In addition, according to the Supreme Court's opinion in our country, the payment of deposit for
                        rent belongs to a "contract for the delivery of a thing". In other words, in addition to the
                        agreement of both parties, there must be a delivery of "money" for the deposit for rent contract
                        to be established. This is particularly important when the ownership of the property changes
                        hands. If there is a transfer of property ownership and the three parties, including the new and
                        old owners and the tenant, do not handle the transfer of the deposit for rent, the court in our
                        country tends to ask the tenant to demand the return of the deposit from the original owner. If
                        the original landlord cannot be found, and the new landlord asks the tenant to pay the deposit
                        for rent, the tenant will suffer losses. Therefore, it is important to remember to reach a
                        consensus among all three parties regarding the return of the deposit for rent to avoid
                        suffering losses.

                        words, in principle, when a leased property is damaged, such as when the roof leaks or the pipes
                        are clogged, the landlord is obliged to repair it for the benefit of the tenant's use. However,
                        the parties may also agree that the tenant (i.e., lessee) is responsible for the repair
                        obligation, or they may agree on which types of property damage are the landlord's
                        responsibility to repair and which types are the tenant's responsibility to repair. As long as
                        the agreement is clearly specified at the time of contract, there is no worry about no one
                        repairing the damaged property, and the landlord can be assured that the property is well
                        maintained, while the tenant can live comfortably and peacefully.

                        The agreement of lease term for rental properties depends on the free agreement of landlords and
                        tenants, whether there is a fixed term and how long it is. However, it should be subject to the
                        limitation of 20 years according to Article 449 of the Civil Code. In addition, according to
                        judicial interpretation, in the case of an indefinite lease term, the lessor (i.e., landlord) is
                        subject to strict limitations under Article 100 of the Land Law when terminating the lease. In
                        other words, the lessor must meet one of the following conditions to terminate the lease:

                Of course, if these are clearly stated in the contract, disputes can be prevented in advance. Therefore,
