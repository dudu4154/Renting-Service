            <h2>❏ Contract Signing</h2>
            <p>
                Dear fellow students, please be reminded that it is important to read the lease carefully before
                signing. You should have the understanding that the law protects those who know how to defend their own
                rights. Therefore, trying to fight for your so-called 'reasonable rights' after the fact may be too
                late.

                    <p>
                        In general, there are various versions of contracts, such as those from bookstores, stationery
                        stores, landlords, schools, and the Ministry of the Interior. Regardless of the version, as long
                        as both parties agree and have no objections to the contents of the contract, and have signed
                        and stamped it, the contract has legal effect and both parties are required to comply and
                        fulfill their obligations.

                <div class="answer_2" id="answer2" style="display: none;">
                    <p>
                        Actually, as long as the terms of the contract do not violate public order, morals, or mandatory
                        legal provisions, they can become a contract after both parties agree. Which version of the
                        contract is better depends on personal needs.
                        <b>
                            For example, for new houses, many additional equipment, or high rental prices, you may
                            consider using a more detailed contract, such as the version provided by the Ministry of the
                            Interior. On the other hand, for general residential use, it is better to choose a contract
                            with fewer provisions.
                        </b>
                        First, it is simple and easy to understand, and secondly, there is more room for negotiation,
                        <b>
                            such as the version provided by Tsui Mama.
                        </b>
                        Secondly, any part of the contract that is not agreed
                        upon is processed according to the provisions of the "Civil Code" in legal procedures.
                        Generally, the "Civil Code" takes into account both parties and considers fairness, which also
                        protects tenants.

                <div class="answer_2" id="answer6" style="display: none;">
                    <p>
                        The notarization fee is calculated based on the higher value between the total rent amount and
                        the current value of the property, plus the amount of the security deposit. This is the
                        requested amount for the notarization. If the requested amount is below 200,000 NTD, the
                        notarization fee is 1,500 NTD (as every lease agreement has compulsory enforcement effect). For
                        other amounts, please refer to the Judicial Yuan website and the 'Notarization Fee Table'.

                        According to Article 12 of the Civil Code, a person becomes an adult at the age of 20.
                        Therefore, it is advisable for minors under the age of 20 to obtain the consent of their
                        parents, legal guardians, or custodians when entering into contracts. Parents should act as
                        joint guarantors when signing the contract to give landlords greater peace of mind when renting
                        to underage students. However, if it can be established that the leased property is necessary
                        for the minor's daily life, such as in the case of a student in pursuit of education, the lease
                        agreement is still valid even without parental consent under the provision of Article 77 of the
                        Civil Code.

                    <h3 onclick="display(this,'answer8')">➥ Is it necessary to sign a rental contract when renting a
                        property?</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="answer_2" id="answer8" style="display: none;">
                    <p>
                        In fact, most agreements can be established through oral agreements and do not necessarily
                        require a written contract to be valid. However, it should be noted that according to Article
                        422 of the Civil Code: 'If the term of a lease contract for real property is over one year, it
                        shall be made in writing. If it is not made in writing, it shall be deemed a lease without a
                        fixed term.' However, since rental periods often involve related matters (such as early
                        termination, repairs, etc.), if there is no written contract, there may be significant disputes
                        between the parties regarding their rights and obligations, and it can be difficult to prove.
                        Therefore, it is important to write down clearly the rights and obligations of both parties in a
                        written contract to avoid disputes and prevent both parties from making unsupported claims,
                        making it difficult for outsiders to clarify the truth of the matter.

                <div class="question">

                <div class="answer_2" id="answer9" style="display: none;">
                    <p>
                        It is best for both parties to have a copy of the signed contract to avoid situations where the
                        tenant cannot review the terms of the contract or negotiate with the landlord based on the
                        agreed-upon content when disputes arise. This can lead to a lack of security for the tenant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, both parties should sign any added or deleted clauses when signing the contract. If
                        these procedures were not carried out in the original contract, tenants should be cautious about
                        the landlord possibly making unauthorized changes to the contract, resulting in a loss of tenant
                        rights.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes, landlords may also worry that tenants will use the contract to report rental income
                        for tax purposes, so they will voluntarily "confiscate" one copy of the contract, making it
                        difficult for tenants to claim deductions based on the contract. Or, the landlord may secretly
                        raise the rent or terminate the lease, causing disputes in the future. However, this should be
                        avoided to prevent conflicts.

                        contract is indeed entitled to rent out the property?</h3>

                <div class="answer_2" id="answer10" style="display: none;">
                    <p>
                        When signing a contract, you can verify the landlord's identity by checking their ID card,
                        property ownership certificate, or property tax statement. However, it is common for someone
                        else, such as a spouse, daughter, or friend, to handle the rental process on behalf of the
                        owner. This does not necessarily mean that these people cannot sign a contract with you, but if
                        you find that the signer is not the actual owner, you should clarify their relationship and
                        confirm that the owner is aware of the situation. You can also request that the landlord bring
                        the actual owner to sign the contract or provide a power of attorney to avoid falling victim to
                        rental fraud.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of course, you can also use the rental address to apply for a land and building registration
                        copy from the land administration agency to verify the landlord. This can also check whether the
                        rental location is currently under seizure (including seizure time, the court accepting the
                        case, and the case number, etc.) or has any mortgage records. This will allow you to rent with
                        peace of mind.

                    <p>
                        When verifying with the landlord, you can apply for a land and building record copy from the
                        land administration agency using the address of the property (preferably with the landlord or
                        owner's name). This not only allows you to check if there is a mortgage or if the property has
                        been seized by a court (pay special attention to the time of seizure, as any rental agreement
                        made after the seizure may be invalidated by the court), but also confirms if the owner of the
                        property is the same person who signed the contract.

                    <p>
                        The landlord may request to retain a photocopy of our ID card, which is probably because they
                        are concerned about any situation that may occur during the lease period and the difficulty of
                        finding tenants without any proof. Similarly, both landlords and tenants can make the same
                        request. However, there may be some concerns about leaving personal identification documents in
                        someone else's hands. If you are worried about identity theft, you can annotate the photocopy
                        with the words "For Rental Use Only".

                <div class="answer_2" id="answer13" style="display: none;">
                    <p>
                        When renting from a sub-landlord, it is important to ask for the lease agreement between the
                        sub-landlord and the primary landlord, and to check whether the lease period has expired to
                        avoid paying the deposit and rent only to find that the sub-landlord has moved out and cannot be
                        found. It is also important to note whether there are any clauses in the agreement prohibiting
                        subletting or assigning of the property, as the sub-landlord has no right to sublet the property
                        to a third party if such a clause exists.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the rental rights and interests of the subtenant only involve the sublandlord, there may
                        be disputes if the landlord asks the subtenant to move out or pay the deposit based on the
                        agreement with the sublandlord. It is recommended to avoid such situations as much as possible.
                        If you want to sublet one of the rooms in the rented property, it is recommended that the
                        subtenant sign the lease directly with the landlord (of course, a new agreement or an adjustment
                        in the original contract should be made between the landlord and the sublandlord regarding the
                        rental scope and rent, for example) to avoid disputes.

                      Standardized lease agreements typically include provisions on rent, lease duration, deposit, 
                      maintenance responsibilities, and other aspects, helping to clarify the rights and obligations 
                      of both parties. The lack of a formal contract may jeopardize the tenant's rights, so it is 
                      advisable to sign a comprehensive lease agreement.

                      If the landlord is unwilling to sign the agreement, it may involve the following legal provisions:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Contract Law</strong>: A lease agreement is a type of contract, and the foundational 
                           law governing contracts is the Contract Law in the Civil Code. If the landlord fails to fulfill
                           the contract or refuses to sign a formal lease agreement, it may violate relevant provisions
                           of the Contract Law.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Lease Regulations</strong>: Various cities and counties in Taiwan usually have 
                          corresponding lease regulations, including details such as rent payment, lease duration, deposit 
                          requirements, and housing maintenance responsibilities. If the landlord violates local lease regulations, 
                          they may face corresponding legal consequences.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Land Value Tax Regulations</strong>: House leasing may also be related to land value tax. 
                          Violating the relevant land value tax regulations could lead to the landlord facing corresponding 
                          legal consequences.
