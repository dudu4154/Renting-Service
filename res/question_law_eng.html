            <h2>❏ Termination/Breach of Contract Issues</h2>
            <p>The issue of early termination of the contract also ranks among the top five disputes. In summary, the
                key to preventing disputes is to carefully review the contract terms before signing it.</p>

                        the semester, one of the roommates expressed unwillingness to continue renting and moved out,
                        but the landlord asked us to bear the full rent, is this reasonable?</h3>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        First, it's best to confirm how your contract was signed. Did you appoint a representative to
                        sign it on behalf of everyone, or did each individual sign with the landlord?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you appointed a representative to sign the contract, you should make that clear. Otherwise,
                        the landlord will only face the person who signed the contract (the "tenant" on the lease), and
                        if they follow the contract and collect the entire rent, there is no illegality involved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Therefore, it is recommended that if you and your roommates are renting a whole house together,
                        do not be afraid of trouble and sign separate contracts with the landlord to protect yourself
                        better. Landlords usually find it troublesome to write separate contracts for each tenant, so
                        you can be flexible and list each tenant's name, scope of lease, and rent on one contract. If
                        each person's scope is clearly defined, the landlord cannot require tenants to pay the full rent
                        for the entire unit if one roommate moves out early, and avoid burdening you.

                            When the leased property has defects that jeopardize safety and health (Article 424 of the

                        <li>
                            When a part of the leased property is destroyed and the remaining portion cannot achieve the
                            purpose of the lease (Article 435 of the Civil Code)

                            When the lessee dies, although the lease agreement has a fixed term, the heir can still
                            terminate the contract, but notice should be given in advance in accordance with Article 452
                            and Article 450, Paragraph 3 of the Civil Code.

                    <h3 onclick="display(this,'answer3')">➥ Is it reasonable for the landlord to withhold the entire
                        deposit if I want to move out before the lease expires?</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="answer_2" id="answer3" style="display: none;">
                    <p>
                        If you want to move out before the end of the lease, it means you are breaking the contract. If
                        there is a clause in the contract regarding compensation for early termination of the lease, you
                        should follow the contract, but the compensation amounts in general contracts for rent often
                        include clauses that not only withhold the entire deposit, but even state compensation amounts
                        as high as five times the deposit. So tenants should be very careful when signing the contract.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the terms of the contract are so harsh and you want to negotiate a lower compensation, please
                        communicate with the landlord properly. After all, you did not object when you signed the
                        contract.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If your contract does not include any termination clauses, it does not mean that you can come
                        and go as you please. If the landlord does not agree with you leaving early, they can demand
                        that you fulfill the contract (even if you do not live there, you still have to pay the rent).
                    </p>

                        termination of a contract when entering into a lease agreement?</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="answer_2" id="answer4" style="display: none;">
                    <p>
                        It is recommended that both parties agree to use an amount equivalent to one month's rent as the
                        basis for the early termination compensation, which is a more reasonable amount.
                    </p>

                <div class="question">
                    <h3 onclick="display(this,'answer5')">➥ When moving out at the end of a lease, is it reasonable for
                        the landlord to withhold the deposit until the water and electricity bills are settled?</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="answer_2" id="answer5" style="display: none;">
                    <p>
                        When the lease expires and it's time to move out, there may be several expenses that cannot be
                        settled immediately, such as water, electricity, gas, telephone bills, and even damages or
                        compensation incurred during the rental period. Therefore, it is reasonable for the landlord to
                        request to retain a portion of the deposit to offset these expenses. However, it is recommended
                        that both parties try to estimate a reasonable price for the offset, and any remaining balance
                        should be refunded first. Then, the landlord can settle with the tenant with receipts or
                        invoices to avoid disputes.

                        Article 425 of the Civil Code stipulates that "If, after the delivery of the leased property,
                        the lessor transfers its ownership to a third party, the lease contract shall continue to exist
                        for the transferee. The preceding provision shall not apply to a lease contract for immovable
                        property that has not been notarized and has a term of more than five years or an indefinite
                        term." This is called "Sale does not terminate lease." In other words, the lease relationship
                        continues to exist for the new owner, and the tenant can still use the property until the end of
                        the lease period. The landlord asks you to move out first to create a simple environment for
                        selling the property more smoothly. Therefore, if you are unwilling to move, you can invoke the
                        provisions of the Civil Code mentioned above, but please also make sure that your deposit has
                        been successfully transferred to the new owner if the landlord sells the property and inform the
                        new owner of the lease to clarify rights and obligations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are willing to cooperate with the landlord to move out, you can check the penalties for
                        early termination of the lease in the lease agreement or negotiate with the landlord on related
                        matters of relocation.

                </div>

                    <p>
                        Article 425 of the Civil Code states that "if the lessor transfers the ownership of the leased
                        property to a third party after the delivery of the property, the lease agreement continues to
                        exist for the transferee. The preceding provision shall not apply to an un-notarized real estate
                        lease contract with a term of over five years or an indefinite term." This is known as "sale
                        does not terminate lease," which means that the lease relationship continues to exist for the
                        new owner, and the tenant can continue to use the property until the end of the lease period.
                        The landlord asks you to move out first because they hope to sell the property in a simpler
                        environment. Therefore, if you are unwilling to move, you can invoke the aforementioned
                        provision of the Civil Code, but also remind you that if the landlord still sells the property,
                        please make sure that your deposit has been successfully transferred to the new owner, and
                        remind the new owner of the lease to clarify the rights and obligations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are willing to cooperate with the landlord to move out, you can check the penalties for
                        early termination of the lease and negotiate with the landlord on related matters regarding
                        moving out in the lease agreement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Article 425 of the Civil Code states that "if the lessor transfers the ownership of the leased
                        property to a third party after the delivery of the property, the lease agreement continues to
                        exist for the transferee. The preceding provision shall not apply to an un-notarized real estate
                        lease contract with a term of over five years or an indefinite term." Let's explain what an
                        indefinite lease is: there are three situations of an indefinite lease:

                    <ol>
                        <li>For a real estate lease contract without a document, if the term of the lease exceeds one
                            year (Civil Code Article 422)</li>
                        <li>When the lease agreement is initially concluded without a term being set.</li>
                        <li>When the lease term expires, and the lessee still enjoys the use and benefits of the leased
                            property, and the lessor does not express opposition (Civil Code Article 451).</li>
                    </ol>

                    Therefore, if you have not established any written agreement with the landlord, it represents an
                    indefinite lease. For an un-notarized indefinite lease, it is usually not eligible for the
                    protection of "sale does not terminate lease."
