                        Renting is a type of contractual agreement. For most types of contracts, they can be established
                        and become effective with just verbal agreement. For example, buying and selling is a type of
                        contractual agreement, as well as buying newspapers or buying vegetables at the market. If we
                        have to sign a contract for every purchase we make, then we would need to carry more contracts
                        than cash when we go shopping or grocery shopping!

                        So basically, in the rental relationship, as long as the landlord and tenant agree on the house
                        and rent, even if they do not sign a contract, both parties will be bound by the valid
                        establishment of the rental relationship and cannot arbitrarily back out, otherwise they will
                        bear legal responsibility. However, during the rental period, due to special provisions of the
                        Civil Code, the presence or absence of a written contract will have a significant impact on the
                        rights and obligations of both parties. This will be explained in detail in later chapters.

                        Many landlords or tenants often request that the lease agreement be notarized, and the
                        difference between notarized and non-notarized leases is often confusing. In principle, even if
                        the lease agreement is not notarized, it can still be legally effective and does not necessarily
                        have to be notarized to be legally effective. The most important purpose of notarizing a lease
                        agreement is to protect the parties so that they can directly apply to the civil enforcement
                        agency of the court for enforcement when the other party fails to perform the contract, without
                        having to waste time and money on litigation. However, the amended Article 425 of the Civil Code
                        in 1999 has made exceptions to the non-fixed term and fixed-term leases exceeding five years, as
                        explained in detail on page three.

                    <p class="typesetting">
                        But the matters that can obtain enforceability through the notarization process are limited to:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            When the lease term expires and the tenant refuses to vacate, the landlord has the right to
                            request the return of the property through legal means.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The right to receive a certain amount of money or other substitutes (such as rice) or
                            negotiable securities (such as a check) as the subject matter of the right.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="typesetting">
                        For example, the landlord's right to demand rent from the tenant, the tenant's right to request
                        the return of the deposit, or the landlord's right to claim compensation from the tenant for
                        damage to the property, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p class="typesetting">
                        Any of the aforementioned rights must be stated in the notarized document and express the
                        intention to accept compulsory enforcement, otherwise it still does not have the direct power of
                        compulsory enforcement. Currently, the notary offices of various courts have well-printed lease
                        notarization formats. As long as the various rights that are intended to be enforced directly
                        are filled in the designated field and notarized, the effect can be achieved, which is
                        considered convenient and can be utilized more.

                        More precisely, the implication of Article 425 of the Civil Code should be "the transfer of
                        ownership does not terminate the lease." This means that if a lease agreement is established
                        first and the tenant moves in to live when the landlord transfers ownership (i.e., sells the
                        house to someone else), the tenant can continue to live in the house without any impact on their
                        rights and interests. At this point, the tenant's landlord automatically changes to the new
                        owner of the house (directly stipulated by law, without any action needed).

                        However, the revised Article 425 of the Civil Code enacted in 1999 imposes restrictions on the
                        scope of application, excluding non-fixed-term lease agreements and fixed-term lease agreements
                        exceeding five years that are not notarized by the court. In other words, if the lease agreement
                        signed is a non-fixed-term lease agreement or a fixed-term lease agreement exceeding five years
                        that is not notarized by the court, the tenant cannot use the reason for moving in and living in
                        the property to oppose the new property owner. Therefore, in these two situations, the tenant
                        will be in a disadvantageous position. This is probably a comprehensive consideration when
                        amending the law to address the problem of false leases.
