                Rent is the consideration for the use and enjoyment of the leased property, so the payment of rent is
                the most important obligation of the tenant. In addition, the agreed-upon rent is also an important
                factor in determining whether a lease agreement has been established. Therefore, in a lease agreement,
                the rent occupies a very important position and cannot be neglected.

                                    The amount of rent: The amount of rent is agreed upon by the parties (landlord,
                                    tenant), but to avoid future disputes between the parties regarding the amount of
                                    rent, it should be clearly stated in the lease agreement.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Payment Method of Rent: The payment method of rent can usually be divided into two
                                    types: installment payment or lump sum payment. Installment payment is more commonly
                                    seen in lease agreements, where both parties agree to pay the rent on the 5th day of
                                    each month, for example. Lump sum payment is more commonly seen near schools, where
                                    rent is usually paid for a semester or academic year.
                                </li>

                                    Payment Period of Rent: After the amount and payment method of the rent have been
                                    agreed upon, don't forget to specify the payment period. If there is no agreement,
                                    it should be paid when the lease term ends according to custom. For installment
                                    payments, rent should be paid at the end of each period.

                            <h3>Effects of Late Rent Payment:</h3>
                            <p class="typesetting">
                                The lessee shall pay the rent on the agreed date and shall not be delayed. The Civil
                                Code also stipulates that late payment of rent may constitute a reason for the lessor to
                                terminate the contract. However, please note that:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Changes in rent due to changes in circumstances: As the leased property is immovable
                                    property and the lease term is indefinite, the rent may be increased or decreased if
                                    the value of the leased property has risen or fallen. The parties may apply to the
                                    court for a rent adjustment. The standard for rent adjustment is based on the value
                                    of the leased property (transaction value), and the addition of equipment to the
                                    leased property may also be a reason to request an increase in rent. However, if the
                                    lease is a fixed-term lease, the rent cannot be changed due to changes in
                                    circumstances, as a fixed-term lease implies an intention not to change the rent
                                    during the lease term.
                                </li>

                                    Reduction of rent due to use relationship: If the leased property is partially or
                                    completely unusable due to reasons beyond the tenant's control, such as natural
                                    disasters, third-party infringement, or the landlord's failure to repair the leased
                                    property, the tenant may request a reduction of rent or termination of the lease
                                    agreement for the part of the property that cannot be used. This is known as the
                                    principle of "partial loss" of the leased property, and the tenant may also seek
                                    compensation for damages.
                                </li>

                            <h3>Collection of Rent and Rental Receipts:</h3>
                            <p class="typesetting">
                                The agreement regarding rent can include the method of collecting rent. The parties may
                                agree in the lease agreement that the tenant shall pay the rent to the landlord on the
                                agreed date, or the landlord may collect the rent from the tenant. It is common for the
                                landlord to collect the rent from the tenant. After the tenant pays the rent, the tenant
                                should request a receipt from the landlord to prove that the rent has been paid
                                correctly.
                            </p>
                            <p class="typesetting">
                                If someone other than the landlord collects the rent, the tenant may refuse to pay
                                unless the rent collector can prove that they are authorized by the landlord to collect
                                the rent. To avoid disputes, the tenant should pay the rent to the party who signed the
                                lease agreement, i.e. the landlord, or at least obtain a receipt signed by the landlord.

                            <h3>Introduction to Security Deposit and Rent Payment:</h3>
                            <p class="typesetting">
                                A rental deposit, also known as a security deposit, is used by a tenant to guarantee the
                                payment of rent at the time a lease agreement is signed. Although the Civil Code does
                                not explicitly regulate rental deposits, they are commonly used in society. The rental
                                deposit serves as security for the tenant's payment of rent. If the tenant does not owe
                                any rent when the lease ends, the landlord should return the rental deposit to the
                                tenant. The scope of the rental deposit includes rent, interest on overdue rent, and
                                damages. The amount of the rental deposit can be agreed upon by the parties, but if it
                                exceeds two months' rent, the tenant can use the excess amount to offset the rent under
                                the Land Law regulations.

                                    At the time of delivering the rental property, it should be in a usable and
                                    well-maintained state: The landlord shall deliver the rental property to the tenant
                                    in a condition consistent with the agreed-upon use and benefits, for example, if the
                                    rental property is agreed to be a commercial building, delivering a residential
                                    property would not be consistent with the agreed-upon use, as the tenant would not
                                    be able to register their business. If the rental property experiences water leakage
                                    or requires repairs that prevent it from being used normally, even after the repairs
                                    are completed, the tenant may terminate the lease agreement.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Obligation to repair the leased property: As a general rule, the landlord should be
                                    responsible for repairing the leased property. However, if there is a special
                                    agreement or customary practice that the landlord is not required to repair, such
                                    agreement or practice shall prevail. The tenant should give the landlord a
                                    reasonable time to make repairs. If the landlord fails to repair the property within
                                    this time frame, the tenant may terminate the lease agreement based on this reason,
                                    or the tenant may repair the property at his/her own expense and then request the
                                    landlord to reimburse the cost or deduct it from the rent. The term 'repair of the
                                    leased property' not only refers to the leased property itself, but also includes
                                    facilities such as stairs, elevators, water, electricity, and other amenities.

                                    Guarantee Liability for Defects in Rental Property: As a paid contract, the
                                    provisions on guarantee liability for defects in sales and purchases also apply to
                                    rental contracts. This can be divided into:
                                    <ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
                                        <li>
                                            Guarantee of Rights Defects: The landlord shall guarantee that any third
                                            party shall not claim any rights to the tenant regarding the leased
                                            property. If a third party claims rights against the tenant and the tenant
                                            is unable to use the leased property, the tenant may request a reduction of
                                            rent or termination of the contract. This situation is most common in the
                                            case of subletting by a second landlord, but if the tenant knows about the
                                            defect of rights (i.e., subletting by a second landlord) at the time of
                                            signing the contract and there is no special agreement, the second landlord
                                            may be exempted from this guarantee obligation.
                                        </li>

                                            Guarantee of defects in leased property: As per the provisions of the Civil
                                            Code, regardless of the agreement in the lease contract, if the leased
                                            property poses a danger to the tenant's health or life safety, the tenant
                                            may terminate the contract. For example, if the tenant discovers that the
                                            leased property is made of sea sand or has radiation hazards.

                                    The obligation to pay all taxes and fees: In principle, the landlord shall bear the
                                    responsibility for paying all taxes and fees related to the leased property.
                                    However, if there is a different agreement in the contract, it should be followed
                                    accordingly.
                                </li>

                                    Reimbursement of beneficial expenses incurred by tenants: If tenants incur
                                    beneficial expenses that increase the value of the leased property and the landlord
                                    is aware of the situation but does not object, the landlord should reimburse the
                                    expenses when the lease ends, but only up to the current increase in value. Any
                                    fixtures installed by the tenant can be removed, but the leased property must be
                                    restored to its original condition. If the landlord objected to the beneficial
                                    expenses at the time, the tenant cannot request reimbursement. However, the tenant
                                    can still claim reimbursement according to the unjust enrichment provisions for any
                                    benefits that exist at the time of contract termination.

                                    The landlord has the right of retention for rent claims: If the tenant fails to pay

                                            Duty of custody of leased property: The tenant shall exercise the care of a
                                            good administrator in preserving the leased property. If the tenant breaches
                                            the duty of custody and causes damage or loss of the leased property, he/she
                                            shall be liable for compensation. However, the Civil Code provides a special
                                            provision in case the house is destroyed by fire, where the tenant shall not
                                            be liable for any compensation unless the fire was caused by his/her
                                            intentional or grossly negligent conduct. Additionally, the tenant shall use
                                            the leased property for profit according to the agreed method. In the
                                            absence of an agreed method, the method shall be determined according to the
                                            nature of the leased property. If the tenant violates this provision and
                                            continues to use the leased property despite the landlord's objection, the
                                            landlord may terminate the contract.

                                            Duty to Notify of Hazards: During the lease term, if repairs are necessary
                                            for the rental property and should be borne by the landlord, or if it is
                                            necessary to install equipment to prevent harm or if a third party asserts
                                            rights over the rental property, the tenant shall notify the landlord
                                            immediately. However, if the landlord is already aware of such issues, this
                                            does not apply. If the tenant fails to make the aforementioned notification
                                            and causes the landlord to be unable to provide timely relief, the tenant
                                            shall compensate the landlord for the damages incurred.

                                            Duty of Tolerance: The tenant must not refuse the necessary actions taken by
                                            the landlord to preserve the leased property.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                    Duty of non-subletting: The tenant may not sublet the leased property to others
                                    without the landlord's consent. However, if the leased property is a house, and
                                    there is no agreement to the contrary, the tenant may sublet a part of it to others.
                                    If the tenant violates this provision by subletting the house to others, the
                                    landlord may terminate the contract. The tenant's subletting of the house to others
                                    does not terminate the lease relationship between the tenant and the landlord. The
                                    landlord is still liable for damages caused by the tenant's subtenant, i.e. the
                                    second tenant. The sublease relationship between the second tenant and the second
                                    landlord remains legally effective, but there may be issues regarding the defect of
                                    the right guarantee. If the landlord terminates the lease, the second tenant cannot
                                    use the property by relying on the sublease contract with the second landlord. The
                                    second tenant can only claim damages from the second landlord. However, if the
                                    landlord demands it, the second tenant still has to move out.

                                <li>
                                    Duty to return the leased property: Upon termination of the lease agreement, the
                                    tenant shall return the leased property in its original condition at the time of the
                                    lease. The term 'original condition' refers to the state of the property that would
                                    be expected after normal use. Otherwise, for parts that are subject to wear and
                                    tear, such as carpets, lighting fixtures, and bathroom facilities, would the tenant
                                    have to renovate everything to avoid liability? However, if the tenant has made
                                    holes, drilled or dug into the rented property for the purpose of installing an air
                                    conditioner or other equipment, the tenant should restore it to its original state.
                                    Failure to do so would result in the tenant being held liable for damages.
