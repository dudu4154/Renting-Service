                Rent is the consideration for the use and enjoyment of the leased property, so the payment of rent is
                the most important obligation of the tenant. In addition, the agreed-upon rent is also an important
                factor in determining whether a lease agreement has been established. Therefore, in a lease agreement,
                the rent occupies a very important position and cannot be neglected.

                                    The amount of rent: The amount of rent is agreed upon by the parties (landlord,
                                    tenant), but to avoid future disputes between the parties regarding the amount of
                                    rent, it should be clearly stated in the lease agreement.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Payment Method of Rent: The payment method of rent can usually be divided into two
                                    types: installment payment or lump sum payment. Installment payment is more commonly
                                    seen in lease agreements, where both parties agree to pay the rent on the 5th day of
                                    each month, for example. Lump sum payment is more commonly seen near schools, where
                                    rent is usually paid for a semester or academic year.
                                </li>

                                    Payment Period of Rent: After the amount and payment method of the rent have been
                                    agreed upon, don't forget to specify the payment period. If there is no agreement,
                                    it should be paid when the lease term ends according to custom. For installment
                                    payments, rent should be paid at the end of each period.

                            <h3>Effects of Late Rent Payment:</h3>
                            <p class="typesetting">
                                The lessee shall pay the rent on the agreed date and shall not be delayed. The Civil
                                Code also stipulates that late payment of rent may constitute a reason for the lessor to
                                terminate the contract. However, please note that:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Changes in rent due to changes in circumstances: As the leased property is immovable
                                    property and the lease term is indefinite, the rent may be increased or decreased if
                                    the value of the leased property has risen or fallen. The parties may apply to the
                                    court for a rent adjustment. The standard for rent adjustment is based on the value
                                    of the leased property (transaction value), and the addition of equipment to the
                                    leased property may also be a reason to request an increase in rent. However, if the
                                    lease is a fixed-term lease, the rent cannot be changed due to changes in
                                    circumstances, as a fixed-term lease implies an intention not to change the rent
                                    during the lease term.
                                </li>

                                    Reduction of rent due to use relationship: If the leased property is partially or
                                    completely unusable due to reasons beyond the tenant's control, such as natural
                                    disasters, third-party infringement, or the landlord's failure to repair the leased
                                    property, the tenant may request a reduction of rent or termination of the lease
                                    agreement for the part of the property that cannot be used. This is known as the
                                    principle of "partial loss" of the leased property, and the tenant may also seek
                                    compensation for damages.
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                        <li>
                            <h3>Collection of Rent and Rental Receipts:</h3>
                            <p class="typesetting">
                                The agreement regarding rent can include the method of collecting rent. The parties may
                                agree in the lease agreement that the tenant shall pay the rent to the landlord on the
                                agreed date, or the landlord may collect the rent from the tenant. It is common for the
                                landlord to collect the rent from the tenant. After the tenant pays the rent, the tenant
                                should request a receipt from the landlord to prove that the rent has been paid
                                correctly.
                            </p>
                            <p class="typesetting">
                                If someone other than the landlord collects the rent, the tenant may refuse to pay
                                unless the rent collector can prove that they are authorized by the landlord to collect
                                the rent. To avoid disputes, the tenant should pay the rent to the party who signed the
                                lease agreement, i.e. the landlord, or at least obtain a receipt signed by the landlord.

                            <h3>Introduction to Security Deposit and Rent Payment:</h3>
                            <p class="typesetting">
                                A rental deposit, also known as a security deposit, is used by a tenant to guarantee the
                                payment of rent at the time a lease agreement is signed. Although the Civil Code does
                                not explicitly regulate rental deposits, they are commonly used in society. The rental
                                deposit serves as security for the tenant's payment of rent. If the tenant does not owe
                                any rent when the lease ends, the landlord should return the rental deposit to the
                                tenant. The scope of the rental deposit includes rent, interest on overdue rent, and
                                damages. The amount of the rental deposit can be agreed upon by the parties, but if it
                                exceeds two months' rent, the tenant can use the excess amount to offset the rent under
                                the Land Law regulations.

                                    At the time of delivering the rental property, it should be in a usable and
                                    well-maintained state: The landlord shall deliver the rental property to the tenant
                                    in a condition consistent with the agreed-upon use and benefits, for example, if the
                                    rental property is agreed to be a commercial building, delivering a residential
                                    property would not be consistent with the agreed-upon use, as the tenant would not
                                    be able to register their business. If the rental property experiences water leakage
                                    or requires repairs that prevent it from being used normally, even after the repairs
                                    are completed, the tenant may terminate the lease agreement.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Obligation to repair the leased property: As a general rule, the landlord should be
                                    responsible for repairing the leased property. However, if there is a special
                                    agreement or customary practice that the landlord is not required to repair, such
                                    agreement or practice shall prevail. The tenant should give the landlord a
                                    reasonable time to make repairs. If the landlord fails to repair the property within
                                    this time frame, the tenant may terminate the lease agreement based on this reason,
                                    or the tenant may repair the property at his/her own expense and then request the
                                    landlord to reimburse the cost or deduct it from the rent. The term 'repair of the
                                    leased property' not only refers to the leased property itself, but also includes
                                    facilities such as stairs, elevators, water, electricity, and other amenities.

                                    Guarantee Liability for Defects in Rental Property: As a paid contract, the
                                    provisions on guarantee liability for defects in sales and purchases also apply to
                                    rental contracts. This can be divided into:
                                    <ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
                                        <li>
                                            Guarantee of Rights Defects: The landlord shall guarantee that any third
                                            party shall not claim any rights to the tenant regarding the leased
                                            property. If a third party claims rights against the tenant and the tenant
                                            is unable to use the leased property, the tenant may request a reduction of
                                            rent or termination of the contract. This situation is most common in the
                                            case of subletting by a second landlord, but if the tenant knows about the
                                            defect of rights (i.e., subletting by a second landlord) at the time of
                                            signing the contract and there is no special agreement, the second landlord
                                            may be exempted from this guarantee obligation.
                                        </li>

                                            Guarantee of defects in leased property: As per the provisions of the Civil
                                            Code, regardless of the agreement in the lease contract, if the leased
                                            property poses a danger to the tenant's health or life safety, the tenant
                                            may terminate the contract. For example, if the tenant discovers that the
                                            leased property is made of sea sand or has radiation hazards.

                                            背保管義務，致租賃物毀損滅失者，應負損害賠償責任。但是在房屋因

                                            失所引起，否則房客可以不負任何損害賠償責任。又房客應依約定方法

                                            ，為租賃物之使用收益，無約定方法者，應依租賃物之性質而定之方法

                                            為之。房客違反此規定，為租賃物之使用，經房東阻止而仍繼續為之，

                                            房東得終止契約。

                                            通知，致房東不能及時救濟者，應賠償房東因此所之損害。

                                    客違反規定，將房屋轉租於他人者，房東得終止契約。房客將房屋轉租

                                    於他人者，其與房東間之租賃關係，仍為繼續。因次承租人（即二房客

                                    ）應負責之事由所生之損害，二房東仍然要負賠償責任。至於次承租人

                                    （二房客）與承租人（二房東）間之租賃關係仍合法生效，但可能發生

                                    權利瑕疵擔保之問題。如大房東終止租約，二房客不得以次承租契約（

                                    亦即與二房東間之租約）向大房東主張仍得使用房屋。此時二房客僅得

                                    向二房東請求損害賠償。但如果大房東要求，仍然必須搬離。

                                    返還租賃物的義務：房客於租賃關係終止後，應依承租時之原狀返還租

                                    賃物。所謂原狀，當然指原來或經常情形下，因經過使用，而應該有的

                                    狀態。否則，如地毯、電燈、衛浴設備…等較有耗損的部份，房客豈不

                                    是需要全部翻新才能脫身﹖但是如果房客為了安裝冷氣或其他設備，而

                                    對所承租的房屋進行鑿洞、釘孔、或挖掘之情形，當然房客應該要回復

                                    原來的樣子，否則便需負賠償責任。
