            <h2>❏ Privacy Issues</h2>
            <p>
                For landlords who often ignore the presence of tenants and enter and exit arbitrarily, it can be a major
                nuisance for tenants. It is recommended that tenants, after understanding their legal rights, engage in
                communication based on reason and empathy to hopefully resolve the issue satisfactorily.

                    <h3 onclick="display(this,'answer1')">➥ My lease is almost up, and I don't plan to renew with the
                        landlord. Recently, the landlord has been constantly bringing new tenants to view the apartment.
                        Is this allowed?</h3>

                    <p>
                        According to Article 421 of the Civil Code: "The lessee refers to the contract where one party
                        leases a property to the other party for use and enjoyment, and the other party pays rent." In
                        other words, when a landlord rents out a property, it means they need to hand over the property
                        to the tenant according to the agreed terms in the contract. The landlord cannot use the excuse
                        of "this is my property" to demand unconditional access for themselves.
                    </p>

                        <b>It is recommended that both parties should respect each other and communicate in advance. The
                            landlord should only enter the rental property with the tenant's agreement or during
                            agreed-upon times to avoid disputes.</b>

                        landlord says that for safety reasons, in case of emergencies, he/she wants to keep a spare key
                        for occasional use. Can tenants refuse this?</h3>

                <div class="answer_2" id="answer2" style="display: none;">
                    <p>
                        After the tenant rents the house, <b>unless there are specific provisions between the two
                            parties, the tenant can change the lock by themselves.</b> However, sometimes landlords may
                        worry that tenants (especially students) forget to turn off the water, electricity, or gas or
                        have other emergencies, and want to check inside the house. Therefore, they may ask to keep a
                        spare key. Of course, tenants have the right to refuse to let the landlord keep a spare key,
                        <b>but it is better for tenants to provide assurance to the landlord and maintain the house as
                            if it were their own home to reduce the landlord's concerns and avoid repeated requests for
                            inspection to put the landlord's mind at ease.</b> However, remember to restore the door
                        lock to its original state when returning the house to the landlord at the end of the contract.
