            <h2>❏ Preface</h2>
            <p>
                In recent years, with the increase in admission rates and the addition of new departments in colleges
                and universities, the situation of students renting outside has become more serious due to the
                inadequate matching of existing school buildings. As a result, the number of safety and dispute issues
                has also increased. Not only has it caused great inconvenience to students' lives, but also, in various
                types of problems, it is found that most of the situations faced by students are similar or even
                repeatedly occurring. It is evident that the problems caused by renting houses are completely unfamiliar
                and often overlooked by young students who lack social experience, and this part often seriously
                interferes with students' study emotions. Therefore, in order to give students a basic understanding of
                rental-related issues, we have specially organized these issues into a practical Q&A format, hoping to
                provide some help to students through explanations of some practical examples.
