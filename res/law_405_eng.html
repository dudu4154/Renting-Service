                        When a landlord and a tenant have a rental dispute, the most direct and fastest way is usually
                        to communicate and coordinate until both parties can accept the solution.

                        When a landlord and tenant have a rental dispute, the most direct and fastest way is usually to
                        communicate and coordinate with each other until both parties can accept a resolution. However,
                        when they cannot reach a consensus, they must resort to the use of force. According to the
                        provisions of Chapters 2 and 3 of Part 2 of the Civil Procedure Law of our country, if certain
                        conditions are met, mediation or a simplified litigation procedure can be chosen.

                        Additionally, on February 3, 1999, the Civil Procedure Act was amended to add Chapter Four of
                        Part Two, which establishes the "Small Claims Procedure" to handle a large number of small
                        monetary disputes that arise in daily life. This avoids the complication and formality of the
                        regular litigation process, ensuring that citizens can protect their rights to small amounts of
                        property without hindrance, which may infringe upon the constitutional rights and cause social
                        injustice and a lack of trust in the judicial system.

                                The characteristics of small claims procedures are simplicity and speed, and they have
                                made some provisions favorable to ordinary people (i.e., non-legal persons, businesses,
                                large companies, etc.) in order to prevent the procedures from becoming obstacles to
                                people's pursuit of their rights. For details, please refer to the appendix on small
                                claims procedures.

                            <li>
                                If the dispute between the landlord and tenant involves an amount of less than
                                NT$100,000, the small claims procedure can be applied, but if the court deems it
                                inappropriate, it can still use the summary procedure according to its discretion. In
                                addition, if the amount of the dispute exceeds NT$100,000 but is still within
                                NT$500,000, the parties can agree to apply the small claims procedure and document it in
                                writing.
                            </li>

                                The small claims court can be held at night, on Sundays, or other holidays. Therefore,
                                in addition to regular business hours, courts provide small claims court services at
                                other times. For detailed operating procedures, please contact the respective courts.
                                However, if either party objects, the court cannot proceed outside of regular business
                                hours.

                                There are still many details about the small claims procedure that have not been fully
                                introduced. Please refer to the relevant laws or consult legal service organizations for
                                more information.
