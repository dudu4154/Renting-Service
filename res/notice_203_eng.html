                For students who are renting a place for the first time and lack experience or familiarity with the
                local environment, the ideal situation is to first seek assistance from the school's accommodation and
                life counseling teams or to check the Truemom website to gain a preliminary understanding of the current
                housing situation and local market. Then, they can use the recommendations of senior students to learn
                about the condition of the room, the landlord, and the roommates to avoid encountering bad landlords or
                poor housing conditions.

                    <p class="typesetting">The channels for students to find housing are as follows: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>School accommodation department and relevant rental housing groups established by the
                            school.</li>
                        <li>Red notices posted on public bulletin boards in the community.</li>
                        <li>Recommendations from classmates, friends and relatives, and advertisements in newspapers.
                        </li>
                        <li>Rental housing websites and online BBS forums.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p class="typesetting">Since the red notices on public bulletin boards and newspapers are often
                        filled with information from real estate agencies, the most effective way to find housing is
                        still through recommendations from classmates. Generally, houses that are cheap and in good
                        condition are less likely to be rented out through advertisements or red notices and are often
                        circulated through niche channels such as recommendations from classmates or "generational
                        transmission" of information between senior and junior students.
                    </p>
                    <p class="typesetting">
                        Many entire houses near schools are rented out to students on a long-term basis, and whenever
                        senior students graduate and move out, other students automatically fill the vacancies through
                        their network of classmates. As a result, these houses rarely enter the rental market and often
                        circulate among a group of direct senior and junior students for several years. Some houses can
                        even be passed down through generations and remain unchanged for more than a decade. Due to the
                        long-term cooperation and trust established between this type of student tenants and landlords,
                        the rent prices are often lower than the market average. Nowadays, it is popular among students
                        to search for rental information on electronic bulletin boards on the internet or BBS forums.
                        Since all major university computer centers have BBS forums, the old goods section or life
                        information exchange section of the website has become a place for exchanging rental
                        information. Moreover, this type of rental information is often posted by student landlords who
                        are subletting their rooms, and the success rate of rental is high due to the specificity of the
                        property.
                    </p>
                    <p class="typesetting">
                        It is worth noting that information on the internet circulates quickly. If the condition of the
                        house is good and the rent is reasonable, it is usually quickly booked. Therefore, it is
                        recommended that when students see a suitable house, they should immediately call the landlord
                        to arrange a viewing and not consider contacting them via email or waiting a few days to contact
                        them, in order to avoid being beaten to the punch by others.

                    <p class="typesetting">
                        However, because most of the information on the Internet is usually open to registration, it is
                        easier for landlords to beautify the condition of the house or have unclear property rights (not
                        the owner of the property or the sublessor). It is recommended that students ask clearly when
                        contacting the landlord by phone to arrange a house visit, to avoid wasting time visiting a
                        house and leaving disappointed.

                        The executive director of the Tsuei Ma Ma Foundation, Lu Bing-yi, stated that due to the poorer
                        economic status of students and the high rent prices in urban areas, smart students have already
                        developed several practical rental strategies to save on expenses.

                                If the area around the school belongs to the expensive rental market, then adopt a
                                commuting approach to rent in the suburbs where the rental prices are lower. Taking the
                                example of National Taiwan University students in Taipei City, because students do not
                                face the same time pressures as working people, they rarely look for housing in the
                                expensive Da'an District near the school. Instead, they rent in cheaper areas like
                                Jingmei, Yonghe, Zhonghe, or even Xindian, and then commute using motorcycles or buses.

                                Students living near a MRT station have a wider range of rental location options to
                                consider. After the MRT lines are in operation, Tamsui, Zhubei, Zhonghe, and Xindian
                                have become new favorite rental locations for students.

                                <b>3. Jointly renting to reduce costs.</b>
                                <br>
                                Sharing one house with three rooms among three students is more cost-effective than
                                renting three separate rooms. Moreover, they have access to shared living spaces such as
                                the living room, kitchen, and bathroom. Sharing a house with like-minded individuals can
                                also help avoid the inconvenience of living with strangers who have different living
                                habits. However, some issues are worth noting. As an example, Lu Bing-yi points out that
                                some students may impulsively pay a deposit when they first see a house they like, only
                                to later discover a better option and lose the deposit because it is non-refundable
                                according to the law. Additionally, some students may sign contracts without
                                understanding them, only to later find themselves in disputes where their rights are not
                                protected. Some landlords may also collect the contracts after they are signed and only
                                return them upon termination of the lease, which is an unreasonable practice that some
                                students may not realize they can refuse.

                        When looking for housing, students usually consider the first criterion to be cheap rent,
                        followed by the closer the better to the school. However, it is still important to remind
                        everyone not to neglect their safety. After all, having personal safety guaranteed makes
                        demanding living quality meaningful. Don't regret it just for the sake of temporarily cheap

                                The number of tenants in the same household should not exceed five to avoid complicated
                                entry and exit of members, and insufficient power supply which can cause danger of wire
                                overheating due to excessive use of extension cords by tenants in different rooms. Check
                                if the wiring is too old and the electrical load is appropriate. If there are black
                                marks near the sockets or circuit breakers, it may indicate previous incidents of wire
                                overheating. Make sure the location of the water heater or gas stove is cool and
                                well-ventilated, and check for rust or damage at the joints of the gas pipeline to

                                Confirm whether the ground floor door can be tightly closed, and the bedroom door lock
                                should be updated or installed with an internal bolt upon move-in. Check if there are
                                sturdy iron bars with anti-theft function around the windows, especially for top-floor
                                houses with public space additions, where door security should be given extra attention.
                                Landlords usually prefer to rent their houses to students with a relatively simple
                                socio-economic background. While the primary consideration for landlords when renting
                                out properties is rental income, in today's society where public safety is deteriorating
                                and conflicts between individuals are becoming increasingly clear, more and more
                                landlords place significant emphasis on the background of potential tenants.
                                Furthermore, renting a property is not a one-time transaction like buying a product.
                                Landlords entrust their multi-million-dollar properties to tenants and have to ensure
                                that rent is paid smoothly every month, so having simple background student tenants
                                indeed gives landlords a sense of security. Landlords believe that even if students have
                                problems, they can always turn to schools or parents for assistance, thus avoiding the
                                tragic situation of an empty apartment. Generally speaking, as long as students show
                                sincerity and politeness during the negotiation process, they are often accepted by
                                landlords as tenants. Therefore, even if students have poor economic conditions and
                                cannot afford high rent, if the landlord is willing to rent to them, they will usually
                                receive some leniency in the rental price.

                        landlord's or others' persuasion. Otherwise, if you regret it later, the deposit will be
                        confiscated by the landlord. Before signing the contract, be sure to ask the landlord to provide
                        identification and proof of ownership of the property to confirm that the landlord is the
                        rightful owner of the property. If it is a sublet, you should pay attention to whether there are
                        clauses prohibiting subletting and the original lease term to avoid future disputes.

                        In addition to specifying the rent, lease term, and when the deposit will be returned in the
                        contract, the responsibility for water and electricity fees, taxes, and property repairs should
                        also be clearly stated in the contract. The condition of the furniture and equipment provided by
                        the landlord and any promises of adding new equipment must be clearly stated in the contract.

                        The rental contract templates available on the market generally provide more protection for the
                        landlord, so it is recommended to read them carefully before signing and strive to delete
                        unreasonable clauses or use the "TMM Version Rental Agreement" available for download on the TMM
                        website. These are just a few precautions for students renting a house. For complete information

                        shoes on the shoe rack outside the door, and remember to change their positions from time to
                        time. You can also ask male classmates or friends to record the answering machine message.

                    <h4>Change the lock, install additional locks, and install iron bars on windows.</h4>
                    <p class="typesetting">
                        When deciding to rent a house, you can ask the landlord to change the lock or change it
                        yourself, and request to install iron doors and windows, or security devices such as peepholes
                        from the inside out. It is recommended to change the lock yourself and keep the old lock. If you
                        move again, you can take your own lock with you and use it in the new place.

                    <h4>You can never be too careful with safety precautions.</h4>
                    <p class="typesetting">
                        Avoid letting others know that you are home alone. If someone visits, confirm their identity
                        before deciding how to handle the situation, and develop the habit of turning off lights and
                        closing windows when not in use. The distance between the rental house and the bus stop,
                        lighting conditions, and whether there are businesses along the way are all factors that female
                        students should consider when deciding whether to rent.

                    <h4>Prevent hidden camera filming by using a pinhole detector.</h4>
                    <p class="typesetting">
                        Some universities spend money on purchasing pinhole detectors, and female students who rent
                        houses off-campus can also apply to the school for detection. However, generally only wireless
                        pinholes can be detected, not wired ones, which are mostly found in shared accommodations with
                        the landlord. Students can also check their homes for pinhole cameras that are smaller than
                        grains of rice and sometimes emit light. If any suspicious light spots are found, they should be
                        checked further. In fact, think about where others might hide a camera to spy on you, such as in
                        the bathroom mirror, facing the shower or bathtub, furniture facing the bed, dressing area, or
                        strange plants, tables, chairs, or sealed spaces above the wardrobe in the room or bathroom. If
                        the landlord acts suspiciously, it is better to be safe than sorry and thoroughly check the
                        room.
