                In principle, the formation of a lease agreement does not require a written contract. It only requires
                the mutual agreement of the parties on the essential elements of the lease, such as the use and benefit
                of the leased property and the payment of rent, and it can become effective without the delivery of the
                leased property.
            </p>
            <p class="typesetting">
                The formation of a lease agreement does not necessarily require a written contract. As long as the
                parties have reached an agreement on the essential elements of the lease, such as the use and enjoyment
                of the leased property and the payment of rent, the lease will become effective, and the delivery of the
                leased property is not necessary. The landlord has the obligation to deliver the leased property to the
                tenant in accordance with the agreed-upon condition (Article 423 of the Civil Code), and the tenant has
                the obligation to pay the rent in accordance with the agreement (Article 439 of the Civil Code).
                Therefore, an oral agreement on a lease contract is valid. However, nowadays most people prefer to
                "contract" with the landlord (or tenant) when renting a property by signing a written lease agreement to
                be cautious. This can provide a written proof and reduce legal disputes.
            </p>
            <p class="typesetting">
                So whether a lease agreement is made orally or in writing, it is valid as long as it meets the
                requirements, and this must be understood first. Secondly, whether the agreement is made orally or in
                writing, once the rental parties have agreed on the terms, the agreement becomes effective immediately.
                This is known as 'a word is worth a thousand pieces of gold.' At this time, it is necessary to pay
                attention to whether the terms of the lease agreement are in line with what is required. Otherwise, once
                the contract is established, both the landlord and the tenant are bound by it. Therefore, the following
                points should be noted when entering into the agreement:

                        On the tenant's side, it is important to verify whether the landlord is the actual owner of the
                        property or not. If the landlord is not the owner, then it is necessary to confirm whether the
                        owner has authorized them to rent out the property on their behalf, for example, by requesting
                        the landlord to provide a letter of authorization or power of attorney from the owner. This
                        relationship needs to be clarified to avoid disputes where the real owner comes forward after
                        the lease has been signed and claims that they did not authorize the rental, leading to the
                        landlord demanding that the tenant vacate the premises. If the tenant is renting from a
                        sublessor, they need to be aware of any restrictions on subleasing imposed by the main landlord.
                        If the main landlord has such a restriction in the lease, they can terminate the lease with the
                        sublessor and demand that the subtenant vacate the property (Civil Code, Article 443), which
                        would result in the tenant's loss of rights.

                    <p class="typesetting">
                        On the landlord's side, it is important to verify the tenant's real identity (name) in order to
                        confirm the recipient of future rent payments or when asserting rights under the contract, in
                        order to avoid confusion and unnecessary trouble.

                        Most people have the experience of looking for rental advertisements along the street, which
                        usually include terms like 'single rooms for rent', 'cozy suites for rent', or 'apartments for
                        rent', and sometimes even specify details such as 'fully furnished', 'no cooking', or 'suitable
                        for both residential and commercial purposes'. These indicate the state of the rental property
                        that the landlord wishes to offer. Prospective tenants can choose what they want, but when
                        actually entering into a lease agreement, they should clarify whether the property is for
                        residential use only or can be used for business purposes, whether subleasing or sharing is
                        allowed, whether furniture is included, and other details related to the rental property's
                        status. This is because it involves what type of property the landlord should deliver to the
                        tenant, and what type of property the tenant should return when the lease ends.

                        As for the rent, in principle, the amount of rent can be freely agreed upon by the landlord and
                        tenant. However, Article 97(1) of the Land Act provides that "the rent for urban houses shall
                        not exceed ten percent of the declared total value of the land and its buildings." This is to
                        limit the rent for houses and protect the usually more vulnerable tenants. As for the security
                        deposit, when renting a house, it is customary in Taiwan to pay a security deposit in addition
                        to the rent. However, Article 99 of the Land Act provides that "the security deposit for a lease
                        shall not exceed two months' rent for the house. If the security deposit already paid exceeds
                        the above limit, the lessee may offset the excess against the rent." The Land Act limits the
                        amount of the security deposit to protect tenants, and both landlords and tenants should pay
                        special attention to this when signing the contract.

                    <p class="typesetting">
                        In addition, according to the interpretation of the Supreme Court of our country, the payment of
                        a security deposit belongs to a "contract for the delivery of things", which means that in order
                        for the contract to be established, in addition to the agreement of both parties, there must be
                        a transfer of "money". This is particularly important when the ownership of the property changes
                        hands. If the transfer of the security deposit is not addressed between the old and new owners
                        and the tenant, and if the original landlord cannot be located, the courts in our country tend
                        to require the tenant to claim the security deposit from the original landlord. If the new
                        landlord then demands payment of a security deposit from the tenant, the tenant will suffer a
                        loss of the original security deposit. Therefore, it is important to remember to address the
                        issue of the return of the security deposit among all three parties to avoid such losses.

                        According to Article 429, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Code: "Unless the contract provides otherwise
                        or there is a custom to the contrary, the lessor shall bear the cost of repairs to the leased
                        property." In other words, in principle, when the rented property is damaged, such as a leaking
                        roof or clogged water pipes, the landlord has an obligation to repair it for the tenant's use.
                        However, the parties may also agree that the tenant (i.e. lessee) is responsible for the repair
                        obligation, or even agree on which types of property damage are the landlord's responsibility to
                        repair and which are the tenant's responsibility to repair. As long as the agreement is clear at
                        the time of contracting, the property will not be left unrepaired in case of damage, and the
                        landlord will not have to worry about poor maintenance of the property, while the tenant can
                        live there comfortably and securely.

                        The agreement on the rental period of the leased property depends on the free agreement between

                        of not exceeding 20 years under Article 449 of the Civil Code. In addition, according to
                        judicial practice, in the case of a lease without a fixed term, the lessor (i.e., landlord) is
                        subject to strict restrictions under Article 100 of the Land Act if he/she wishes to terminate
                        the lease, i.e., the lessor must meet one of the following conditions:

                            deposit (rental deposit) is used to offset the amount owed.

                        landlord should pay special attention to whether a term is to be specified in the contract. If
                        the lease exceeds one year, a written contract must be signed and the special provisions of

                    penalty clauses, agreement on jurisdiction by a certain court, or even dispute resolution methods,
                    etc. Of course, if they are explicitly stated in the contract, disputes can be prevented in advance.
