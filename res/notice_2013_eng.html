                Most landlords are kind and willing to take care of students, but conflicts between landlords and
                students still occur from time to time. Of course, some maliciously bully students, but it is also
                common to encounter attitude issues during communication, especially when the rights and obligations
                relationship is unclear. One party often arrogantly demands that the other party cooperate to improve
                the situation, resulting in arguments. This is particularly true for older landlords who may not be able
                to handle the demands of a young student. They may become defensive and even resort to personal attacks,
                leading to a standoff between the two parties and resulting in a heated argument.

                There have been cases of landlords chasing students with knives, and incidents where students
                intentionally damaged the landlord's property out of anger before leaving. All these cases stem from a
                lack of clear understanding of rights, coupled with poor communication. Therefore, the following basic
                principles of communication are summarized in the hope that if there is consensus, it can reduce
                subsequent unpleasant incidents:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Establish the relationship between rights and obligations before communicating.</li>

                <li>Talk to your teacher and parents first about how to start the conversation.</li>

                <li>
                    Don't get angry, rather talk about it some other time, and don't make hurtful remarks when you are
                    angry. Do not be angry and make hurtful remarks.
                </li>

                <li>
                    If you really can't get the person to stop being agitated, get a teacher to help.

                    When coordinating, you need to know:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Recognizing that things cannot be restored to their original undamaged state, there must be
                            some concessions.
                        </li>

                        <li>Set a bottom line, losing a little is winning.</li>

                        <li>
                            Even if you are in the right, sometimes you have to know when to give in a little. Being too
                            insistent can make it difficult for the mediator to handle and waste time and energy. If you
                            can reduce the consumption of mental and time resources, that is the ideal outcome.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            After accepting the results of the mediation, one must fulfill them and cannot retract or
                            overturn them.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

                Director Feng said that the carefulness of viewing the rental property and the occurrence of disputes
                before the start of the tenancy are equivalent. If many situations can be detected in advance by viewing
                the property, the probability of regret will be reduced, and the demands on the landlord will be
                reduced. The relationship between each other can naturally be maintained in a peaceful and calm state.
