                    <p>Basic calculation concepts for water, electricity, and gas fees:
                        1 unit of water = 1 metric ton = 1000 kg = 1000 liters = 1 cubic meter = approximately 2.3 NTD.
                        1 unit of electricity = 1 kilowatt/hour. The calculation method can be referred to as follows:

                    <p>
                        You should negotiate with the landlord. Otherwise, if it is not stated in the lease agreement,
                        the landlord, as the owner of the property, has the obligation to pay according to the Apartment
                        Building Management Regulations and the community regulations. It is recommended to clarify and
                        include the management fee payment obligation in the lease agreement if the rented property is
                        subject to management fees.

                        previous tenant failed to pay for several months, and now the property manager keeps urging me
                        to do so?</h3>

                    <p>
                        The landlord is responsible for paying the overdue management fees left by the previous tenant.
                        If there was an agreement between the landlord and the previous tenant that the tenant should
                        bear the responsibility, the landlord may seek compensation from the previous tenant after
                        paying the fees. The new tenant is not obligated to pay the unpaid management fees left by the
                        previous tenant.
