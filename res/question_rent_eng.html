              It is a commitment made before the fulfillment of the contract,
              usually when the tenant intends to rent the property after viewing
              it, and the landlord is willing to rent it to them. The tenant
              will pay a certain amount of money to the landlord in advance to
              ensure that both parties will fulfill the lease. Article 248 of
              the Civil Code stipulates that 'if one of the parties to a
              contract receives a deposit from a third party, it is presumed
              that the contract has been established.'

              <b class="rent_title">Rental Deposit: </b><br />
              The official legal term for it is 'rental deposit', but it is
              commonly referred to as a security deposit, guarantee deposit, or
              collateral deposit, etc. Its purpose is to guarantee the tenant's
              payment of rent, compensation for any damages caused to the
              property by the tenant, and the return of the property by the
              tenant at the end of the lease term.

              <b class="rent_title">Rental Payment: </b><br />
              The amount of money that must be paid regularly to the landlord
              for renting a house, until the end of the lease period. It is
              usually paid on a regular basis, such as monthly, quarterly, or by
              semester.

              There is no set limit on the amount of the deposit, and landlords
              usually set the amount and require tenants to pay it. Some
              landlords may require a deposit of tens of thousands of dollars,
              while others may only ask for 500 or 1,000 dollars. In fact,
              regardless of the amount of the deposit, it represents a
              commitment to the lease, and the amount should be determined based
              on the strength of the leasing intentions of both parties.
              Otherwise, if one party backs out, according to Article 249 of the
              Civil Code, the fault lies with that party and the other party can
              request confiscation or double return of the deposit.

              <b class="rent_title">Rental Deposit: </b><br />
              Although it is common practice in the private sector to require a
              deposit of three months or even more, according to Article 99 of
              the Land Law, the deposit may not exceed twice the rent
              (equivalent to two months' rent). The excess portion can be
              claimed by the tenant as payment for rent. However, in practice,
              when tenants exercise their right to offset rent, they should
              first notify and communicate with the landlord to avoid disputes.

              Unless otherwise agreed, the deposit paid by the tenant should be
              refunded or can be used as part of the rent or deposit when
              fulfilling the contract. Therefore, when paying the deposit,
              please remember to ask the landlord to sign the receipt (sample
              deposit receipt), indicating the amount of the deposit paid, the
              names, ID numbers, and deposit retention period of both the payee
              and the payer, and the compensation method for violating the
              agreement, in order to avoid situations where one party refuses to
              rent after paying the deposit but cannot claim compensation.

              According to Article 249 of the Civil Code, "When a contract
              cannot be performed due to reasons attributable to the party who
              paid the earnest money, the earnest money shall not be claimed for
              refund..." In other words, when the tenant (the party who paid the
              earnest money) fails to fulfill the promise to rent the house, the
              landlord cannot be requested to return the earnest money.
            </p>
            <p>
              'When a contract cannot be performed due to the fault of the party
              who received the deposit, the other party shall be entitled to a
              refund of twice the amount of the deposit received; ...' That is
              to say, when a landlord (the party who received the deposit)
              cannot fulfill the promise to rent the house to the tenant, the
              tenant can demand double compensation from the landlord.
            </p>
            <p>
              'If a contract cannot be performed due to a cause not attributable
              to either party, the deposit shall be returned'. This means that
              if unexpected events such as the 921 earthquake, flooding caused
              by typhoons, or unforeseen details that were not discussed during
              the house viewing lead to either party being unwilling to rent the
              house, the other party cannot withhold the deposit or demand
              double compensation.
